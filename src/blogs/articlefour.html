        <h1>Great Is The Enemy Of Good</h1>

          &ldquo;Good is the enemy of the great&rdquo; is a phrase whose inverse is attributed to Voltaire, and is a sentiment which has been echoed by many throughout history. More recently it was popularised by Jim Collins, the author of &ldquo;Good To Great: Why Some Companies Make The Leap&#8230;And Others Don&rsquo;t&rdquo;. In the book he cautions how the &lsquo;good enough&rsquo; mindset can prevent individuals, teams, or companies from ascending to truly &lsquo;great&rsquo;.<br>
          <br>
          Collins chronicles the stories of various companies that have made the leap from good to great, great being defined as achieving financial performance several multiples of the market average in their industries, and contrasts this with the companies that never made that leap, or even lost their position at the top.<br>
          <br>
          It makes sense for businesses to have this mindset because offering more value to your customers than your competitors is a sure-fire way to success. In individual endeavors however, there is a dark side to this sentiment which too often leads to the perfectionist trap.<br>
          <br>
          I recently came across the opposite phrase &ldquo;Great is the enemy of good&rdquo; and have spent a lot of time thinking about it this week, as it is something that I can definitely relate to.<br>
          <br>
          A lot of the time trying to make something truly great from the get-go can prevent us from making something that is simply &lsquo;good&rsquo;, and because we so often want great and not just &lsquo;good&rsquo;, we often struggle to get things off the ground due to analysis paralysis, and sometimes give up altogether.<br>
          <br>
          I think it is important for us to always remember that effective work is more about forward movement towards a desired outcome and is not necessarily about ensuring nothing gets spilled or knocked over in the process.<br>
          <br>
          Instead of expecting &lsquo;eureka!&rsquo; moments, we should be prepared for the unsexy gradual improvement that will eventually constitute &lsquo;great&rsquo;.<br>
          <br>
          For example instead of waiting for the day you&rsquo;ve formulated a completely airtight business plan, simply start the business and learn and adjust as you go. Instead of trying to remove every bug, simply release the beta. Instead of trying to add a plethora of fancy features, simply ship your minimum viable product, and release improvements later.<br>
          <br>
          This advice is especially applicable to writing, as any writer will tell you that there is nothing more daunting than staring at a blank page. When it comes to writing I especially struggle with the issue of striving for really &lsquo;great&rsquo;, to the detriment of progress in the form of disciplined consistent writing, which ironically would result in better work in a shorter amount of time.<br>
          <br>
          In keeping with my blogs focus on the productivity/self-help hacks that I have found to work for me, I will share the techniques I have recently started to use to overcome the perfectionist trap not just in my writing but in the completion of any project.<br>
          <br>
          The first is an idea of quantity being better than quality in the early stages of any creative endeavour. The premise is that repetition and iteration are the fastest ways to improve the quality of your work, as opposed to trying to birth a perfectly composed work from the jump.<br>
          <br>
          In his book Atomic Habits, James Clear tells the story of Jerry Uelsmann, a pioneering American photographer who is a professor at the University of Florida. On the first day of class one semester, he split his film photography students into two groups.<br>
          <br>
          &ldquo;Everyone on the left side of the classroom, he explained, would be in the &ldquo;quantity&rdquo; group. They would be graded solely on the amount of work they produced. On the final day of class, he would tally the number of photos submitted by each student. One hundred photos would rate an A, ninety photos a B, eighty photos a C, and so on.<br>
          <br>
          Meanwhile, everyone on the right side of the room would be in the &ldquo;quality&rdquo; group. They would be graded only on the excellence of their work. They would only need to produce one photo during the semester, but to get an A, it had to be a nearly perfect image.<br>
          <br>
          At the end of the term, he was surprised to find that all the best photos were produced by the quantity group. During the semester, these students were busy taking photos, experimenting with composition and lighting, testing out various methods in the darkroom, and learning from their mistakes. In the process of creating hundreds of photos, they honed their skills. Meanwhile, the quality group sat around speculating about perfection. In the end, they had little to show for their efforts other than unverified theories and one mediocre photo.&rdquo;<br>
          <br>
          Because there was no pressure on being perfect on the quantity group, there was less friction in the way of taking photos, which is ironically the very thing which makes one better at photography, not planning, not strategizing, but actually going out there and taking a bunch of shots.<br>
          <br>
          The second tip is from the renaissance man himself Tim Ferris, where in an interview with Neil Strauss on the challenges of writing, he explains his &ldquo;two crappy pages&rdquo; rule. For Tim, the all too frequent writers block and blank page syndrome is managed by routine.<br>
          <br>
          Two crappy pages every day, no matter what. Those two pages help him get started, and there isn&rsquo;t any pressure on them to be great, two crappy pages is enough.<br>
          <br>
          This can be applied to any goal or project, with the literary equivalent of &ldquo;two crappy pages&rdquo;. For writing blog posts my equivalent is &ldquo;250 crappy words every day&rdquo;.<br>
          <br>
          The trick is to make your &ldquo;two crappy pages&rdquo; non-negotiable. When we set deadlines or hard targets, we are forced to commit, no matter how begrudgingly. The funny thing is, once you&rsquo;ve done the hard task of sitting down and just starting, you often hit a groove and find yourself effortlessly making progress on the daunting task that had you paralysed for hours/days/weeks prior.<br>
          <br>
          Nothing encourages the perfectionist trap more than moveable deadlines. The moment we get in the habit of postponing, suddenly whatever it is we are working on isn&rsquo;t good enough.<br>
          <br>
          And so Tim sits down every day and busts out his two crappy pages, cutting the especially crappy bits on another day, editing the rest on another, and boom, you&rsquo;ve got yourself 5 New York Times Best-Sellers.<br>
          <br>
          In job interviews, a universally asked question is &ldquo;what do you think is your greatest weakness?&rdquo;, and so often will the response be &ldquo;actually I&rsquo;m a bit of a perfectionist, I like things to be done to a really good standard which can sometimes be an issue&rdquo; that it&rsquo;s almost a standing joke at this point.<br>
          <br>
          This answer of course follows the &lsquo;provide a strength disguised as a weakness&rsquo; strategy, which is even taught by interview coaches. The irony however is that what most people refer to as &lsquo;perfectionism&rsquo; is indeed a weakness, not a strength disguised as a weakness.<br>
          <br>
          In referencing the paralysing effect of the pursuit of perfection, Voltaire, the French writer, said &ldquo;The best is the enemy of the good.&rdquo; Voltaire isn&rsquo;t alone in this critique of the perfectionist trap, with Confucius saying, &ldquo;Better a diamond with a flaw than a pebble without.&rdquo;<br>
          <br>
          And, of course, there&rsquo;s Shakespeare: &ldquo;Striving to better, oft we mar what&rsquo;s well.&rdquo;<br>
          <br>
          For most of us, we can get obsessed with this idea of what things need to look like, or how things need to be just right before we make a start. In day to day life, this often means not making a start on projects important to us, or agonising over tedium and losing sight of the forest for the trees.<br>
          <br>
          The perfectionist trap is what Steven Pressfield would call a manifestation of resistance, and if we want proof of that we need only look at the difference in our forward progress when we are being perfectionists versus when we are not.
