        <h1>The Power of Constraints</h1>

        <p>
          Procrastination. It's something we've all dealt with at some point. While it seems like a simple matter of putting off tasks, it's a multi-faceted issue with various contributing factors. In my case, I've realised that two major culprits are ineffective planning and a lack of constraints. Here's my take on it.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Understanding Procrastination</strong><br>
          When stuck in a rut, the best course of action is often to do something, anything. Even if it's unrelated to the task at hand, it breaks the lethargy. The simple act of getting out of bed or the chair and being active, however mundane the activity may be, creates a momentum that combats procrastination.<br>
          <br>
          Procrastination for me tends to strike only for a specific kind of task. The task is usually sufficiently challenging so as to elicit some discomfort at the thought of doing it as opposed to the less daunting task/thing I'm currently doing.<br><br>
          More often than not, it also tends to have vague completion criteria, or objective criteria for what a job well done looks like. 
          This may have nothing to do with the overall project itself, which may be well defined. What will be ill-defined is the chunk that I've decided to work on for that day or week.
          <br><br>
          The reason for this lack of precise criteria I can measure my progress by (constraints), is often because 
          I haven't defined them well enough personally. They may look like 'work on x task for 2 hours'. 
          And because I haven't defined what success would look like for this task today, my mind goes to the only well defined
          criteria available, which is often what the finished project will look like. This can often be daunting,
          and cause a background anxiety and unease since it <em>feels</em> like you have a lot more to do (an entire project)
          than you actually do, as opposed simply working on a small piece of the project/task today, 
          which is the only way we ever do work anyway, one thing at a time.<br><br>
          
          Interestingly, I've found it's harder to actively procrastinate on important tasks than to passively 
          procrastinate. While active procrastination would involve doing something fun or productive in 
          a different capacity, such as sight-seeing or lunch with friends, passive procrastination usually looks 
          like a never-ending spiral down the social media or YouTube rabbit hole. The fact that my procrastination 
          is almost never 'active' tells me that there is something about just simply doing <em>anything</em> 
          constructive, like going for a walk, that inhibits whatever 
          it is that leads to procrastination.<br><br>
          <strong>Doing vs Not Doing</strong><br>
          One principle I've discovered and have come to call the 'do something' principle is that doing something, 
          anything, today significantly increases the chance of ones being productive tomorrow. Likewise, avoiding a 
          task today decreases the likelihood of tackling it tomorrow. Momentum really matters.<br>
          <br>
          This tells me that there is something far deeper than psychology going on here. It's almost mechanical, 
          like physics.<br><br>
          Procrastination paints an intimidating picture of tasks. But, once you begin, you'll find that doing the 
          work is far less uncomfortable than thinking about it. As Seneca famously said, <em>&quot;we suffer more often 
          in imagination than in reality&quot;</em>, and I can honestly say that I have never felt more uncomfortable 
          doing a task, a workout, or an errand I have been putting off more than I did thinking (and procrastinating) about it before I 
          started it.<br>
          <br>
          For me, ineffective planning and the absence of constraints are the primary causes of procrastination. 
          Let's delve into the latter, which I believe is far more important, and something I refer to as my 
          'Theory of Constraints'.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Embracing Constraints</strong><br>
          If you find yourself putting off a task until a deadline is looming, with the knowledge that the process
          will be far smoother and more comfortable should you just start now, you're not alone.
          Because the time it 
          takes to complete a task can to stretch to the full time you've allotted to it, in a counterintuitive 
          sense it makes sense that we sometimes procrastinate.<br>
          <br>
          <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/blog/productivity/what-is-parkinsons-law" target="_blank">Parkinson's Law</a> 
          is the old adage that work expands to fill the time allotted for its completion. The term 
          was first coined by Cyril Northcote Parkinson in a humorous essay he wrote for &quot;The Economist&quot; 
          in 1955. He shares the story of a woman whose only task in a day is to send a postcard&#8202;-&#8202;a task 
          which would take a busy person approximately three minutes. But the woman spends an hour finding the card, 
          another half hour looking for her glasses, 90 minutes writing the card, 20 minutes deciding whether or not 
          to take an umbrella along on her walk to the mailbox&#160;&#8230; and on and on until her day is filled. 
          This pattern emerges because we don't set upper limits on task time and task quality, which can lead to 
          endless tinkering and &quot;perfecting&quot;.<br>
          <br>
          In the absence of constraints, we will often take far longer to do something than is necessary. Each 
          task seems daunting, often leading to procrastination. But when a deadline draws close, it serves a 
          much-needed constraint, setting clear boundaries for task completion.<br>
          <br>
          To combat the &quot;Parkinsonian problem,&quot; I've learned to set strict time limits and quality 
          standards for tasks. Not only does this approach make me more efficient, but it also frees me from 
          the stress of unmet, unrealistic expectations. I have learnt that procrastination has no greater an ally 
          than 'perfectionism'. <br><br>
          By being happy with good enough, and prioritising taking action,
          it makes it irrational for me to put off a task. When a person struggles with analysis 
          paralysis and the perfectionist trap, I think there is a tendency towards procrastination on daunting 
          tasks. I have sometimes spent way more time on a task or an assignment than was necessary, 
          precisely because I lacked realistic constraints. If I start working on something now which is supposed 
          to take four days, but is due in a week, I will sometimes spend until the deadline working on it.<br>
          <br>Those extra three days are rarely necessary, and usually make little difference to the overall quality 
          of the work, the most important components of which will have been completed within the original time-frame.
          When faced with this conundrum, procrastination may actually be our minds way of lightening what it knows 
          to be an unreasonable load, by allowing the external constraint, the deadline, to move us into action, four
          to five days out in this case. It is our subconscious forcing us to economise our time and resources, since 
          the conscious self has failed to do so.<br><br>
          It also provides an incentive to get your work started on time/not procrastinate, as you are not bound 
          between the time from now until the deadline, but rather, the time from now until your self-imposed 
          deadline. If you go by the former then you may only act when that calculus becomes reasonable. I'm sure an economist would be able to describe this much more eloquently, because I feel like this is an economic problem. By setting a self-imposed constraint of 'two days', I become free to start that task well before the external constraint of 'two days' sets in, ie. before I am two days out from the external deadline.<br>
          <br>
          Setting constraints on tasks in ones personal life and projects is a powerful tool against 
          procrastination. The real world consequences of procrastination in work and academia mitigate much of it, 
          but it is in our personal lives, goals, projects, relationships etc. where it is most pernicious, since there 
          are no real external deadlines for the things we care about, just the deadlines we set ourselves.
