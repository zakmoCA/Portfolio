            <p>Four Thousand Weeks</p>
            <p>
              Assuming you live to 80, you&rsquo;ll have lived about four thousand weeks. If you&rsquo;re anything like me and want to make the most of those four thousand or however many thousand weeks we actually get, then look no further than Oliver Burkeman&rsquo;s instant classic here.<br>
              <br>
              I must say, this is a different kind of &lsquo;productivity&rsquo; book if you&rsquo;re into that kind of thing, and it really flips the conventional productivity tips and tricks on their head, the author describing himself as a recovering productivity addict and wants us to think about time management through the lens if our imminent mortality.<br>
              <br>
              I came across this on Ali Abdaal&rsquo;s channel last year and have just finished rereading it for the third time. Now I have three key takeaways from this book;<br>
              <br>
              Embracing finitude as the solution to what Burkeman calls existential overwhelm and the efficiency trap.<br>
              Becoming a better procrastinator, as Burkeman states that the real measure of any time management technique is whether or not it helps you neglect the right things.<br>
              Acknowledging the inevitability of discomfort<br>
              Considering how little time we have on this earth, you would think time management would be everyone&rsquo;s concern. Arguably, time management is all life is. Although time management is really important, the way we generally think of it in society, which might have something to do with all that&rsquo;s been written on the subject, is about getting as much done as we humanly can. It&rsquo;s about streamlining and making efficient even the most mundane of tasks, like email, but little thought is ever given to whether or not we should be trying to squeeze as much as possible from our day.<br>
              <br>
              This was immediately interesting to me, I have been introduced to this idea that less is more by Greg McKeown in Essentialism, and somewhat tangentially by Cal Newport in Deep Work.<br>
              <br>
              Burkeman says that &ldquo;the real problem isn&rsquo;t our limited time. The real problem is that we&rsquo;ve unwittingly inherited, and feel pressured to live by, a troublesome set of ideas about how to use our limited time, all of which are pretty much guaranteed to make things worse.&rdquo;<br>
              <br>
              When you are faced with too many demands on your time, it is easy to think the only answer is to make better use of your time, instead of asking whether the demands themselves are reasonable. Time then becomes a thing you feel the need to dominate and control, if you are to avoid feeling guilty, panicked, or overwhelmed. The solution to this according to Burkeman, which brings me to my first key takeaway is embracing finitude.<br>
              <br>
              You&rsquo;ll never be able to master your time, and the more work we do, the more there is to do.<br>
              <br>
              Oliver Burkeman was a productivity nut, who spent years trying to optimise his time management skills, when one day he had an epiphany; his efforts to optimise his time were futile.<br>
              <br>
              Sure he could get to inbox zero, but getting really good at responding to emails only led to more emails, while the things he actually valued like researching for articles he had planned to write, were left undone.<br>
              <br>
              Burkeman had fallen into what he calls the efficiency trap. Rendering yourself more efficient will generally not result in you having more time because all else being equal, your demands will increase to offset the benefits. &ldquo;Even the winners find their reward is to continue working with crushing intensity&rdquo;.<br>
              <br>
              This can lead to a feeling of existential overwhelm, where we feel like there&rsquo;s an inexhaustible supply of things that seem worth doing, and we can&rsquo;t possibly get around to doing them all. So what&rsquo;s the solution?<br>
              <br>
              Choose. Choose what is important, what deserves your time. &ldquo;Once you no longer need to convince yourself that you&rsquo;ll do everything that needs doing, you&rsquo;re free to focus on doing a few things that count.&rdquo; Trying to &lsquo;get everything done&rsquo; is another way of trying to avoid the question of what to truly do with your finite time.<br>
              <br>
              One reason I think this is one of the best productivity books I&rsquo;ve read, is that Burkeman delves to the core of the human condition, and comes at time management from a philosophical angle.<br>
              <br>
              Fretting to and fro, taking on inconceivable numbers of projects, it&rsquo;s almost as if we are staunchly denying our impending mortality. Truly recognising the shortness of life, and the massive limits that places on what you can reasonably get done in a lifetime, would force you to give up on almost all your pursuits, all but the most important ones.<br>
              <br>
              This loss of optionality is scary for some, it definitely was for me. The decision to do any given thing will automatically mean sacrificing an infinite number of potential alternative paths.<br>
              <br>
              So how can we overcome this? By becoming better procrastinators.<br>
              <br>
              &ldquo;The real measure of any time management technique is whether or not it helps you neglect the right things.&rdquo;<br>
              <br>
              Burkeman provides three principles to do this; paying yourself first, limiting your &lsquo;work in progress&rsquo;, and &lsquo;resisting the allure of middling priorities.<br>
              <br>
              Principle 1 &mdash; Pay Yourself First<br>
              <br>
              This comes from the personal finance principle of paying yourself first whenever you receive your paycheque.<br>
              <br>
              The idea is that you take a specified amount, let&rsquo;s say 20% of your pay, and put it straight into a savings account or investment portfolio, the reasoning being that by paying yourself first, you are ensuring you are continuously working towards your financial goals, and not simply just saving money whenever you happen to have money left in the bank at the end of your pay cycle. By doing it first, you ensure it happens, every pay-cycle.<br>
              <br>
              We can pay ourselves first with regards to our time by carving out time to tackle the things most important to us each day, preferably in the morning.<br>
              <br>
              This way we make sure those things don&rsquo;t simply remain an afterthought, but that they get done each day.<br>
              <br>
              If a certain activity really matters to you, a creative project for example, carve out an hour each morning before you start getting ready for work to get it done.<br>
              <br>
              Principle 2 &mdash; Limit Your Work in Progress<br>
              <br>
              Having a lot of &lsquo;started but not finished&rsquo; projects does not make you productive, it just makes you distracted.<br>
              <br>
              I am guilty of this one big time, and feel like the subconscious reason I do this is because it allows me to feel like I&rsquo;m &lsquo;doing something&rsquo; as I have plenty of irons in the fire, and think I am making progress on all fronts.<br>
              <br>
              In reality, I am making progress on no fronts, because each time one of these side projects gets difficult or boring or frightening, I can bounce off to something else instead. This lets us preserve our sense of &lsquo;being in control of things&rsquo; but at the cost of never finishing anything important.<br>
              <br>
              This can be avoided by fixing a hard upper limit on what you are allowed to work on at any given time, and the author gives us the concept of the open and closed list, which is just brilliant.<br>
              <br>
              Your open list has everything you&rsquo;d like to get done with no regard for time, but the closed list has only 3 slots. You don&rsquo;t get to move something from the open list to the closed until you&rsquo;ve made space for it, so until you&rsquo;ve crossed off 1 of the 3 items in your closed list. Focusing on the closed list allows you to do what matters and prevents half finished projects.<br>
              <br>
              This ties well into principle 3, which is to resist the allure of middling priorities.<br>
              <br>
              Principle 3 &mdash; Resist The Allure of Middling Priorities<br>
              <br>
              Warren Buffet has a principle, its come to be known as the 5/25 rule; it goes like this.<br>
              <br>
              List your top 25 professional goals, this can also include personal goals as well, from most important to least important. Now cross out goals 6 to 25, and disregard them entirely. This is because the remaining 20 goals are insufficiently important enough to form the core of your life, but they&rsquo;re the ones that are seductive enough to distract you from what really matters.<br>
              <br>
              Learning to say no isn&rsquo;t just about saying no to the things you don&rsquo;t want to do, it also applies to the things you do want to do, but that are not priorities for your fulfilment and happiness.<br>
              <br>
              Now this brings us to our third and final key takeaway, which I think is the most important because it ties everything in together, and that is acknowledging the inevitability of discomfort.<br>
              <br>
              This discomfort Burkeman is talking about, this existential overwhelm, of dread, of the fear of missing out, is why we fall into things like the efficiency trap, and take on more than we can handle, with our real priorities sometimes being casualties in the process.<br>
              <br>
              The solution, says Burkeman, is to accept that this unpleasantness, is what it feels like for finite humans to commit ourselves to the kinds of demanding and valuable tasks that force us to confront our limited control on how our lives unfold.<br>
              <br>
              Steven Pressfield calls this &lsquo;unpleasantness&rsquo; the &lsquo;Resistance&rsquo; in his book The War of Art, which I definitely recommend. We often face resistance which you can think of as the thing that stops you or makes it difficult to the things you need to do, and the more important and/or challenging a task is, the more resistance we will face.<br>
              <br>
              This resistance is why it is easy to get distracted, and to distract ourselves with less important tasks whenever we feel uncomfortable by the challenge of the task in front of us.<br>
              <br>
              Burkeman says that what we think of as distractions, aren&rsquo;t the ultimate cause of our being distracted, but that they are just the places we go to seek relief from this feeling of &lsquo;discomfort&rsquo;, this &lsquo;resistance&rsquo;, this discomfort of confronting our finitude, our limited time.<br>
              <br>
              &ldquo;Some Zen Buddhists hold that the entirety of human suffering can be boiled down to this effort to resist paying full attention to the way things are going, because we wish they were going differently (&lsquo;This shouldn&rsquo;t be happening!&rsquo;), or because we wish we felt more in control of the process. There is a very down-to-earth kind of liberation in grasping that there are certain truths about being a limited human from which you&rsquo;ll never be liberated. You don&rsquo;t get to dictate the course of events. And the paradoxical reward for accepting reality&rsquo;s constraints is that they no longer feel so constraining.&rdquo;<br>
              <br>
              There is no fancy way around it other than just acknowledging this discomfort, and acknowledging that this finitude is what it means to be human. And because we can&rsquo;t possibly do everything we would like to, it behooves us choose the few things that matter, sacrifice everything else, and deal with the inevitable sense of loss that results from time to time.

            <p>The Pathless Path</p>
            <p>
              &ldquo;The Pathless Path: Imagining a New Story for Work and Life&rdquo; offers a fresh perspective on how to live a fulfilling life by breaking free from conventional paths and societal expectations.<br>
              <br>
              The book invites readers to embrace uncertainty, tap into their imagination and creativity, and undertake self-discovery to create a life and career that is authentic and fulfilling.<br>
              <br>
              Re-evaluating Conventional Paths<br>
              <br>
              The author challenges the notion that there is only one &ldquo;right&rdquo; way to live a fulfilling life and encourages readers to question their own beliefs and priorities. Society often imposes certain expectations about what a successful life and career should look like, but these paths may not align with one&rsquo;s goals and values. By re-evaluating these conventional paths, individuals can explore new opportunities and possibilities that align with their unique strengths, interests, and goals. This leads to a more fulfilling life as individuals are able to pursue what they truly care about, instead of conforming to societal expectations.<br>
              <br>
              Embracing Uncertainty<br>
              <br>
              The book encourages readers to embrace uncertainty and take calculated risks in pursuit of their passions and goals. By letting go of the need for certainty and control, we are free to explore new avenues and opportunities that we may have previously overlooked. This leads to a more fulfilling life as we are able to take charge of our own lives and make choices that align with our goals and values, rather than feeling held back by fear of the unknown.<br>
              <br>
              The Power of Imagination<br>
              <br>
              The author emphasizes the power of imagination and creativity in shaping one&rsquo;s life and career path. By using imagination, one can envision new possibilities and opportunities for ones life and career that may have previously seemed untenable, or too risky. Additionally, imagination and creativity can help individuals stay motivated and inspired, and provide them with a sense of purpose and meaning.<br>
              <br>
              The Importance of Self-Discovery<br>
              <br>
              Taking time to reflect and understand one&rsquo;s values, strengths, and weaknesses is a recurring theme in this book. When walking a pathless path, one needs to make good decisions repeatedly, and therefore self-knowledge is paramount. Through self-discovery, individuals are able to gain clarity about what they truly care about and what they want out of life. This leads to a more fulfilling life as individuals are able to make decisions that align with their values and goals, rather than feeling stuck in a life or career that does not resonate with them.<br>
              <br>
              Creating a New Story<br>
              <br>
              Readers are invited to reimagine their life and career story and to embrace a pathless path that is authentic and fulfilling. By breaking free from conventional paths and societal expectations, individuals are free to create a life and career that is uniquely their own.<br>
              <br>
              &ldquo;The Pathless Path: Imagining a New Story for Work and Life&rdquo; offers a refreshing perspective on how to live a fulfilling life. By re-evaluating conventional paths, embracing uncertainty, tapping into imagination and creativity, undertaking self-discovery, and creating a new story, individuals are able to break free from societal expectations and pursue a path that is authentic and fulfilling.

            <p>Aug 2, 2020 | 2 mins</p>
            <p>Congruence As A Life-Hack</p>
            <p>
              &ldquo;Behavior that is incongruent with the self will not last&rdquo; says James Clear in his best-seller Atomic Habits.<br>
              <br>
              What James Clear is referring to here by &lsquo;congruence&rsquo; is an idea explored by American Psychologist Carl Rogers, building on the work of Abraham Maslow and Maslow&rsquo;s heirarchy. Rogers believed that for a person to achieve self-actualization, they must be in a state of congruence.
              
              When our ideal self, and our actual self are consistent or very similar, a state of congruence exists. Naturally, it is rare for one to achieve a state of total congruence.<br>
              <br>
              Rogers believed that we want to feel, experience, and behave in ways consistent with our self-image.<br>
              <br>
              This has profound implications for someone on the journey of self-development.<br>
              <br>
              If for example, we think of ourselves as &lsquo;not a runner&rsquo; then it is much easier to skip out on our run for the afternoon, as we are not technically acting inconsistently with our perceived identity.<br>
              <br>
              One of the key things James Clear harps on about in Atomic Habits is just how much &lsquo;identity change&rsquo; matters in establishing and maintaining habits.<br>
              <br>
              The thesis of the book is that instead of thinking &lsquo;I want to do x&rsquo; we need to instead think &lsquo;I want to be the kind of person that does x&rsquo; or &lsquo;I want to be an x person&rsquo;.<br>
              <br>
              So instead of &lsquo;I want to start running&rsquo;, think &lsquo;I want to be a runner&rsquo;. Once something is ingrained in our identity, performing the action is effortless, as we are just &lsquo;being ourselves&rsquo;.<br>
              <br>
              I like to use my own version of this, that I call the &lsquo;congruence hack&rsquo;.<br>
              <br>
              This is done by performing an action which in turn forces me to perform another action, just so as to stay consistent with the first action.<br>
              <br>
              Otherwise it will have been for nothing and pretty stupid to have done.<br>
              <br>
              I&rsquo;m not really a morning person, but I make it a habit to always wake up early and to get started on my days work around 5am.<br>
              <br>
              My reasoning is that if I wake up at 5am, get out of bed, shower, and pour myself a cup of tea, it would then be inconceivable to do anything else but attack the days work that is in front of me.<br>
              <br>
              Because why else would I have left the comfort of my bed a few hours before I needed to?

            <p>Great Is The Enemy Of Good</p>
            <p>
              &ldquo;Good is the enemy of the great&rdquo; is a phrase whose inverse is attributed to Voltaire, and is a sentiment which has been echoed by many throughout history. More recently it was popularised by Jim Collins, the author of &ldquo;Good To Great: Why Some Companies Make The Leap&#8230;And Others Don&rsquo;t&rdquo;. In the book he cautions how the &lsquo;good enough&rsquo; mindset can prevent individuals, teams, or companies from ascending to truly &lsquo;great&rsquo;.<br>
              <br>
              Collins chronicles the stories of various companies that have made the leap from good to great, great being defined as achieving financial performance several multiples of the market average in their industries, and contrasts this with the companies that never made that leap, or even lost their position at the top.<br>

              It makes sense for businesses to have this mindset because offering more value to your customers than your competitors is a sure-fire way to success. In individual endeavors however, there is a dark side to this sentiment which too often leads to the perfectionist trap.<br>
              <br>
              I recently came across the opposite phrase &ldquo;Great is the enemy of good&rdquo; and have spent a lot of time thinking about it this week, as it is something that I can definitely relate to.<br>
              <br>
              A lot of the time trying to make something truly great from the get-go can prevent us from making something that is simply &lsquo;good&rsquo;, and because we so often want great and not just &lsquo;good&rsquo;, we often struggle to get things off the ground due to analysis paralysis, and sometimes give up altogether.<br>
              <br>
              I think it is important for us to always remember that effective work is more about forward movement towards a desired outcome and is not necessarily about ensuring nothing gets spilled or knocked over in the process.<br>
              <br>
              Instead of expecting &lsquo;eureka!&rsquo; moments, we should be prepared for the unsexy gradual improvement that will eventually constitute &lsquo;great&rsquo;.<br>
              <br>
              For example instead of waiting for the day you&rsquo;ve formulated a completely airtight business plan, simply start the business and learn and adjust as you go. Instead of trying to remove every bug, simply release the beta. Instead of trying to add a plethora of fancy features, simply ship your minimum viable product, and release improvements later.<br>
              <br>
              This advice is especially applicable to writing, as any writer will tell you that there is nothing more daunting than staring at a blank page. When it comes to writing I especially struggle with the issue of striving for really &lsquo;great&rsquo;, to the detriment of progress in the form of disciplined consistent writing, which ironically would result in better work in a shorter amount of time.<br>
              <br>
              In keeping with my blogs focus on the productivity/self-help hacks that I have found to work for me, I will share the techniques I have recently started to use to overcome the perfectionist trap not just in my writing but in the completion of any project.<br>
              <br>
              The first is an idea of quantity being better than quality in the early stages of any creative endeavour. The premise is that repetition and iteration are the fastest ways to improve the quality of your work, as opposed to trying to birth a perfectly composed work from the jump.<br>
              <br>
              In his book Atomic Habits, James Clear tells the story of Jerry Uelsmann, a pioneering American photographer who is a professor at the University of Florida. On the first day of class one semester, he split his film photography students into two groups.<br>
              <br>
              &ldquo;Everyone on the left side of the classroom, he explained, would be in the &ldquo;quantity&rdquo; group. They would be graded solely on the amount of work they produced. On the final day of class, he would tally the number of photos submitted by each student. One hundred photos would rate an A, ninety photos a B, eighty photos a C, and so on.<br>
              <br>
              Meanwhile, everyone on the right side of the room would be in the &ldquo;quality&rdquo; group. They would be graded only on the excellence of their work. They would only need to produce one photo during the semester, but to get an A, it had to be a nearly perfect image.<br>
              <br>
              At the end of the term, he was surprised to find that all the best photos were produced by the quantity group. During the semester, these students were busy taking photos, experimenting with composition and lighting, testing out various methods in the darkroom, and learning from their mistakes. In the process of creating hundreds of photos, they honed their skills. Meanwhile, the quality group sat around speculating about perfection. In the end, they had little to show for their efforts other than unverified theories and one mediocre photo.&rdquo;<br>
              <br>
              Because there was no pressure on being perfect on the quantity group, there was less friction in the way of taking photos, which is ironically the very thing which makes one better at photography, not planning, not strategizing, but actually going out there and taking a bunch of shots.<br>
              <br>
              The second tip is from the renaissance man himself Tim Ferris, where in an interview with Neil Strauss on the challenges of writing, he explains his &ldquo;two crappy pages&rdquo; rule. For Tim, the all too frequent writers block and blank page syndrome is managed by routine.<br>
              <br>
              Two crappy pages every day, no matter what. Those two pages help him get started, and there isn&rsquo;t any pressure on them to be great, two crappy pages is enough.<br>
              <br>
              This can be applied to any goal or project, with the literary equivalent of &ldquo;two crappy pages&rdquo;. For writing blog posts my equivalent is &ldquo;250 crappy words every day&rdquo;.<br>
              <br>
              The trick is to make your &ldquo;two crappy pages&rdquo; non-negotiable. When we set deadlines or hard targets, we are forced to commit, no matter how begrudgingly. The funny thing is, once you&rsquo;ve done the hard task of sitting down and just starting, you often hit a groove and find yourself effortlessly making progress on the daunting task that had you paralysed for hours/days/weeks prior.<br>
              <br>
              Nothing encourages the perfectionist trap more than moveable deadlines. The moment we get in the habit of postponing, suddenly whatever it is we are working on isn&rsquo;t good enough.<br>
              <br>
              And so Tim sits down every day and busts out his two crappy pages, cutting the especially crappy bits on another day, editing the rest on another, and boom, you&rsquo;ve got yourself 5 New York Times Best-Sellers.<br>
              <br>
              In job interviews, a universally asked question is &ldquo;what do you think is your greatest weakness?&rdquo;, and so often will the response be &ldquo;actually I&rsquo;m a bit of a perfectionist, I like things to be done to a really good standard which can sometimes be an issue&rdquo; that it&rsquo;s almost a standing joke at this point.<br>
              <br>
              This answer of course follows the &lsquo;provide a strength disguised as a weakness&rsquo; strategy, which is even taught by interview coaches. The irony however is that what most people refer to as &lsquo;perfectionism&rsquo; is indeed a weakness, not a strength disguised as a weakness.<br>
              <br>
              In referencing the paralysing effect of the pursuit of perfection, Voltaire, the French writer, said &ldquo;The best is the enemy of the good.&rdquo; Voltaire isn&rsquo;t alone in this critique of the perfectionist trap, with Confucius saying, &ldquo;Better a diamond with a flaw than a pebble without.&rdquo;<br>
              <br>
              And, of course, there&rsquo;s Shakespeare: &ldquo;Striving to better, oft we mar what&rsquo;s well.&rdquo;<br>
              <br>
              For most of us, we can get obsessed with this idea of what things need to look like, or how things need to be just right before we make a start. In day to day life, this often means not making a start on projects important to us, or agonising over tedium and losing sight of the forest for the trees.<br>
              <br>
              The perfectionist trap is what Steven Pressfield would call a manifestation of resistance, and if we want proof of that we need only look at the difference in our forward progress when we are being perfectionists versus when we are not.

            <p>Friction, And Why You Should Get A Kindle</p>
            <p>
              If you are an avid reader, or would like to read more, purchasing a kindle has probably crossed your mind.<br>
              <br>
              I had been entertaining the idea for some time in 2019 when I decided to just do it, and boy has it been worth it.<br>
              <br>
              Before buying the kindle, I had read only three books in the previous twelve months, something I was hoping to improve.<br>
              <br>
              In the twelve months since purchasing it, I have completed 48 books, almost a book a week!<br>
              <br>
              Now you&rsquo;d think I would be happy with this progress, but actually when I sat down one day and really thought about why I&rsquo;ve managed to read so much more over the last year compared to the year before, I arrived at an unsettling conclusion.<br>
              <br>
              The only thing that had changed upon purchasing the kindle was that it removed a lot of the friction in the way of reading.<br>
              <br>
              I no longer needed to go to the library/bookstore for books.<br>
              <br>
              No needing to carry heavy books with me on my travels.<br>
              <br>
              I would simply purchase/download the books I&rsquo;m interested in en masse and pick up the kindle whenever I felt like reading.<br>
              <br>
              The reason I find this unsettling is that none of these reasons concern desire or motivation.<br>
              <br>
              I was not any more motivated to read over the last year than I had been the year before.<br>
              <br>
              I did not desire or value reading any less in my three-book year.<br>
              <br>
              I would just as often find myself coming across a title I want to read and putting a reminder in my phone to get it at the library or purchase it.<br>
              <br>
              But I rarely did.<br>
              <br>
              The sheer difference in reading volume across the two years is simply due to this idea of friction.<br>
              <br>
              I am deeply fascinated by the neuroscience and psychology of habit formation and performance, and so had come across one of the core tenants of behaviour change, &ldquo;make it easier&rdquo;, many times.<br>
              <br>
              However, this past week I was given a masterclass on this topic in the form of Roger Dooley&rsquo;s &ldquo;FRICTION: The Untapped Force That Can Be Your Most Powerful Advantage&rdquo;. Roger Dooley is a keynote speaker, marketing consultant and Forbes contributor.<br>
              <br>
              So what is friction?<br>
              <br>
              In physics, friction is the resistance to motion of one object moving relative to another.<br>
              <br>
              Friction always works in the direction opposite to the direction in which the object is moving or trying to move.<br>
              <br>
              Roger Dooley describes how friction can result in lost profits for companies both on the consumer end in losing sales and on the labour end in terms of lost workplace productivity. This idea can also be applied to our own personal projects and goals.<br>
              <br>
              Let&rsquo;s say you have the goal of eating healthier and want to shed a few pounds, and one of your sticking points is the amount of takeaway lunches you have at work.<br>
              <br>
              A solution to this could be to pack your healthy lunch every morning before work, or bulk prep your meals in advance.<br>
              <br>
              The idea is that when the moment of hunger arrives, eating healthy isn&rsquo;t the harder option to do, because you already have some healthy and delicious ready-made meals, which are even quicker to prepare than takeaways thanks to microwaves.<br>
              <br>
              Most of the time our brain is not so much concerned with doing the right or wrong thing, so much as the easy thing.<br>
              <br>
              If we make the right thing easier to do, we dramatically increase our likelihood of doing it, as we already have an inclination to want to do the right thing to begin with.<br>
              <br>
              Sometimes we just need a little nudging is all. BJ Fogg is the author of Tiny Habits, and at Stanford he directs the Behaviour Design Lab.<br>
              <br>
              <img src="/images/foggmodel.png" alt="">
              <br>
              Fogg Behaviour Model<br>
              In the figure above, you can see the Fogg Behaviour Model.<br>
              <br>
              The model proposes that three elements must converge at the same moment for a behaviour to occur: motivation, ability, and a trigger. When a behaviour does not occur, at least one of those three elements is missing.<br>
              <br>
              As can be observed by the action line, the harder something is to do, the more motivation is required to do it, and the opposite is true.<br>
              <br>
              If you want a behaviour to take place, looking for ways to boost motivation or ability is the key.<br>
              <br>
              However, boosting ability is far more effective.<br>
              <br>
              Most of us already have pretty sincere desires and motivations when it comes to the things we want to do and can still be no closer to progress than we were yesterday.<br>
              <br>
              Making the behaviour easier to do, or in other words, reducing the friction of said behaviour has a much more profound effect on the slope of the action line.<br>
              <br>
              Throwing your gym bag and clothes in the car before work so it is that much easier to train after work. Prepping your healthy meals for the week so it is that much easier to stick to your diet later on when cravings strike. All these things reduce the levels of motivation needed in the moment, as the behaviour has now become easier to do.<br>
              <br>
              Decision fatigue is a real thing, and the less we have to summon extraordinary sums of willpower to do the right thing in the moment, the more likely we are to do it.<br>
              <br>
              In the landmark 1998 study, Muraven and colleagues showed how self-control is a limited resource, much like a muscle, which gets depleted with use throughout the day.<br>
              <br>
              As the day wears on, the less willpower we will have to do/not do certain things, which is why reducing friction and therefore needing substantially smaller amounts of willpower is effective.<br>
              <br>
              Reading for me no longer involves having to go all the way to the bookstore or library to find a book, it is as simple as purchasing it on my kindle, which is never too far away.<br>
              <br>
              By simply making it easier to do, it is now a habit. No extra motivation necessary.<br>
              <br>
              Ever since then, I have been trying to find areas of friction in other parts of my life and either reduce it to promote a certain behaviour or increase it to avoid others.<br>
              <br>
              There is a quote often attributed to Bill Gates where he says he always finds a lazy person to do a hard job because the lazy person will find an easy way to do it.<br>
              <br>
              If we treat ourselves like that lazy person and try to remove as much obstacles from our path to increase our likelihood of success, we will do much better than the slightly stronger-willed version of ourselves who is always swimming against the tide.
