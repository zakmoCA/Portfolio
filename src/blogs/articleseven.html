        <h1>Procrastination, Parkinson's Law, and The Power of Constraints</h1>

          Procrastination. It's something we've all dealt with at some point. While it seems like a simple matter of putting off tasks, it's a multi-faceted issue with various contributing factors. In my case, I've realised that two major culprits are ineffective planning and a lack of constraints. Here's my take on it.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Understanding Procrastination</strong><br>
          When stuck in a rut, the best course of action is often to do something, anything. Even if it's unrelated to the task at hand, it breaks the lethargy. The simple act of getting out of bed or the chair and being active, however mundane the activity may be, creates a momentum that combats procrastination.<br>
          <br>
          Interestingly, I've found it's harder to actively procrastinate than to passively procrastinate. While active procrastination involves deliberate efforts like sight-seeing or lunch with friends, passive procrastination usually looks like a never-ending spiral down the social media rabbit hole. The fact that my procrastination is almost never 'active' tells me that there is something about just doing things that inhibits whatever it is that precipitates procrastination.<br>
          <br>
          My working theory is one of cognitive dissonance. When I'm actively procrastinating, cognitive dissonance sets in real fast. I feel immense discomfort if I am being otherwise productive or 'active' but not focusing on the important/urgent task I should be. It's a tug-of-war between wanting to be useful and the pull of unfinished tasks. It's a struggle I've written about before, where congruence between intent and action can help overcome resistance.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>The Impact of Doing or Not Doing</strong><br>
          One principle I've discovered and have come to call the 'do something' principle, is that doing something, anything, today significantly increases the chance of ones being productive tomorrow. Likewise, avoiding a task today decreases the likelihood of tackling it tomorrow. Momentum really matters. My level of output on any given day is almost always a function of my level of output in the preceding few days, regardless of how I am feeling, whether I am in sickness or in health etc.<br>
          <br>
          This tells me that there is something far deeper than psychology going on here. It's almost mechanical, like physics. I refer to such principles as the 'physics of being human', and this particular branch of 'physics' in regards to my life is as immutable as the actual laws of physics.<br>
          Procrastination paints an intimidating picture of tasks. But, once you begin, you'll find that doing the work is far less uncomfortable than thinking about it. As Seneca famously said, &quot;we suffer more often in imagination than in reality&quot;, and I can honestly say that I have never felt more uncomfortable doing a task I have been putting off more than I felt thinking (and procrastinating) about it before I started it.<br>
          <br>
          For me, ineffective planning and the absence of constraints are the primary causes of procrastination. Let's delve into the latter, which I believe is far more important, and something I refer to as my 'Theory of Constraints'.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Embracing Constraints</strong><br>
          Often, I procrastinate until a deadline looms, forcing me into action. However, because the time it takes me to complete a task tends to stretch to the full time I've allotted to it, in a counterintuitive sense it makes sense that I sometimes procrastinate. This is a massive breakthrough I;ve had recently, in regards to understanding what contributes to my procrastination.&#160;<br>
          <br>
          Parkinson's Law is the old adage that work expands to fill the time allotted for its completion. The term was first coined by Cyril Northcote Parkinson in a humorous essay he wrote for &quot;The Economist&quot; in 1955. He shares the story of a woman whose only task in a day is to send a postcard&#8202;-&#8202;a task which would take a busy person approximately three minutes. But the woman spends an hour finding the card, another half hour looking for her glasses, 90 minutes writing the card, 20 minutes deciding whether or not to take an umbrella along on her walk to the mailbox&#160;&#8230; and on and on until her day is filled. This pattern emerges because I don't set upper limits on task time and task quality, which can lead to endless tinkering and &quot;perfecting&quot;.<br>
          <br>
          In the absence of constraints, we will often take far longer to do something than is necessary. Each task seems daunting, often leading to procrastination. But when a deadline draws close, it serves a much-needed constraint, setting clear boundaries for task completion.<br>
          <br>
          To combat the &quot;Parkinsonian problem,&quot; I've learned to set strict time limits and quality standards for tasks. Not only does this approach make me more efficient, but it also frees me from the stress of unmet, unrealistic expectations. It makes it irrational for me to procrastinate, compared to before where it was perfectly rational for me to not want to spend four days doing something which can be done to a reasonable quality over two days.<br>
          <br>
          It also provides an incentive to get your work started on time/not procrastinate, as you are not bound between the time from now until the deadline, but rather, the time from now until your self-imposed deadline. If you go by the former then you will only act when that calculus becomes reasonable. I'm sure an economist would be able to describe this much more eloquently, because I feel like this is an economic problem. By setting a self-imposed constraint of 'two days', I become free to start that task well before the external constraint of 'two days' sets in, ie. before I am two days out from the external deadline.<br>
          <br>
          In conclusion, setting constraints on tasks is a powerful tool against procrastination. It can make the difference between spiralling into passivity and making strides towards your goals. It's not just about doing the work; it's about creating a roadmap for when and how to do it. Ultimately, it's about taking control of your time and productivity. Don't let procrastination steal your momentum&#8202;-&#8202;harness the power of constraints!
