          <em>&quot;Are you a writer who doesn’t write, a painter who doesn’t paint, an entrepreneur who never starts a venture? Then you know what Resistance is.&quot;</em><br><br>
          I’ve just recently re-read The War of Art by Steven Pressfield, for the first time in years. In The War of Art, Steven Pressfield manages to succinctly articulate an idea that I have always been aware of in the abstract but could never quite categorise into any psychological/emotional phenomenon.<br><br>
          This idea is that of “Resistance” and how it is the invisible hand which obstructs all forms of progress, in both personal and professional endeavours. Most of us may be familiar with Resistance’s primary manifestation; procrastination. The books primary thesis is that most of us have two lives; the life we live, and the unlived life within us. Between the two stands Resistance.<br><br>
          <em>&quot;Every sun casts a shadow, and genius’s shadow is Resistance. As powerful as is our soul’s call to realization, so potent are the forces of Resistance arrayed against it. Resistance is faster than a speeding bullet, more powerful than a locomotive, harder to kick than crack cocaine. We’re not alone if we’ve been mowed down by Resistance; millions of good men and women have bitten the dust before us. And here’s the biggest bitch: We don’t even know what hit us. I never did. From age twenty-four to thirty-two, Resistance kicked my ass from East Coast to West and back again thirteen times and I never even knew it existed. I looked everywhere for the enemy and failed to see it right in front of my face.&quot;</em><br><br>
          Although the clever title (a play on Sun Tzu’s The Art of War) was what convinced me to give this book a chance, this dramatic opening passage definitely captured me. The book tackles the challenges of trying to create any form of art, or intellectual pursuit. The following is a list Pressfield provides, in no particular order, of those activities which most commonly elicit Resistance:
          <ol>
            <li>The pursuit of any calling in writing, painting, music, film, dance, or any creative art, however marginal or unconventional.</li>
            <li>The launching of any entrepreneurial venture or enterprise, for profit or otherwise.</li>
            <li>Any diet or health regimen.</li>
            <li>Any program of spiritual advancement.</li>
            <li>Any activity whose aim is tighter abdominals.</li>
            <li>Any course or program designed to overcome an unwholesome habit or addiction.</li>
            <li>Education of every kind.</li>
            <li>Any act of political, moral, or ethical courage, including the decision to change for the better some unworthy pattern of thought or conduct in ourselves.</li>
            <li>The undertaking of any enterprise or endeavour whose aim is to help others.</li>
            <li>Any act that entails commitment of the heart. The decision to get married, to have a child, to weather a rocky patch in a relationship.</li>
            <li>The taking of any principled stand in the face of adversity.</li>
          </ol><br>
          In other words, any act that rejects immediate gratification in favour of long-term growth, health, or integrity. Expressed another way, any act that derives from our higher nature instead of our lower.<br><br>
          Because this list essentially covers anything worthwhile we would want to do in life, it is vital that we both understand and combat Resistance.<br><br>
          The book is split into 3 parts:
          <ul>
            <li>Book One: Resistance — Defining The Enemy</li>
            <li>Book Two: Combating Resistance — Turning Pro</li>
            <li>Book Three: Beyond Resistance — Higher Realm</li>
          </ul><br><br>
          Book One: Resistance — Defining The Enemy<br><br>
          In Book One: Resistance, Pressfield basically destroys every reason you’ve ever rationalized for not getting something done. Accomplishing your goals (creative, business, or otherwise) is a battle. You are fighting Resistance. And this Resistance is manifested in all kinds of ways; procrastination, criticizing others, fear, and many others. Here is an excerpt from the first few pages of Book One:<br><br>
          <em>&quot;Have you ever brought home a treadmill and let it gather dust in the attic? Ever quit a diet, a course of yoga, a meditation practice? Have you ever bailed out on a call to embark upon a spiritual practice, dedicate yourself to a humanitarian calling, commit your life to the service of others? Have you ever wanted to be a mother, a doctor, an advocate for the weak and helpless; to run for office, crusade for the planet, campaign for world peace, or to preserve the environment? Late at night have you experienced a vision of the person you might become, the work you could accomplish, the realized being you were meant to be?
          Look in your own heart. Unless I’m crazy, right now a still, small voice is piping up, telling you as it has ten thousand times before, the calling that is yours and yours alone. You know it. No one has to tell you. And unless I’m crazy, you’re no closer to taking action on it than you were yesterday or will be tomorrow. You think Resistance isn’t real? Resistance will bury you.&quot;</em><br><br>
          Pressfield here states the obvious, that there seems to be something standing in the way of us living in accordance with our highest values. I think we all understand this in some sense, and intellectually we recognise that it is just a matter of putting one foot in front of the other in order to achieve any arbitrary goal, like lose x kilograms or learning y skill. However, if we were then to be asked WHY we do not do so, well then we’d shrug our shoulders and mutter something along the lines of “it’s hard” or “I don’t have the time” or worst of all “I don’t think I can do it”.<br><br>
          What is not so obvious to most people, and most certainly was not obvious to me, is that the reason these things are difficult is due to what Pressfield calls Resistance.<br><br>
          So how would one exactly define Resistance? Pressfield describes it as a dark force which cannot be seen, touched, heard, or smelled, and it’s sole purpose is to prevent us from doing our ‘work’. Resistance is hesitation, procrastination, fear, self-doubt, rationalisations, and self-limiting beliefs. Pressfield gets very animated in his descriptions of it;
          <ul>
          <li><em>&quot;Resistance is like the Alien, or the Terminator, or the shark in Jaws. It cannot be reasoned with. It understands nothing but power. It is an engine of destruction, programmed from the factory with one object only: to prevent us from doing our work. Resistance is implacable, intractable, indefatigable. Reduce it to a single cell and that cell will continue to attack. This is Resistance’s nature. It’s all it knows.&quot;</em></li>
          <li><em>&quot;Resistance will tell you anything to keep you from doing your work. It will perjure, fabricate, falsify; seduce, bully, cajole. Resistance is protean. It will assume any form if that is what it takes to deceive you. It will reason with you like a lawyer or jam a nine-millimeter in your face like a stickup man. Resistance has no conscience. It will pledge anything to get a deal, then double-cross you as soon as your back is turned. If you take Resistance at its word, you deserve everything you get.&quot;</em></li>
          </ul>
          While certainly dramatic, Pressfield here accurately describes what’s behind the voice that tells us “I can always start my diet tomorrow…but for now let’s have one last slice of pizza”, and diet here can be replaced with business, book, education etc.<br><br>
          What is more, even the best amongst us face it. Pressfield writes about how Henry Fonda was still throwing up before each stage performance, even when he was seventy-five. In other words, the fear never really goes away. He argues that the warrior and the artist live by the same code of necessity, which dictates that the battle must be fought anew every day.<br>
          A lot of the time this is all just too much for us, and we find ourselves procrastinating on the things most important to us. Procrastination is the most common manifestation of Resistance as it is the easiest to rationalise. We do not tell ourselves “I’m never going to write my symphony.” Instead we say, “I am going to write my symphony; I’m just going to start tomorrow.” Those of us who have been students can definitely relate to this, although procrastination is far more insidious in real life than it is in school/university, where you have the external accountability of deadlines. There are no real deadlines except death for achieving the things you want to from life, no threat of failing a subject or potentially wasting thousands of dollars.<br>
          Book Two: Combating Resistance — Turning Pro<br><br>
          In the second part of the book, Pressfield argues that the way to overcome Resistance is by “Turning Pro”. He provides multiple distinctions between the ‘pro’ and the ‘amateur’, which paints a helpful picture for the reader.<br><br>
          The professional here does not refer to those of the professions, like a lawyer or a doctor, but rather the professional as an ideal, and more importantly the professional in contrast to the amateur.<br><br>
          The distinction drawn between the pro and amateur is primarily one of attitude. He argues that we are all pros already in one area; our jobs, which provides a useful way of thinking about what Pressfield is calling the professional here.<br><br>
          He says that we show up every day, no matter what. We stay on the job all day, our minds may wander but our bodies remain at the wheel. We are committed over the long haul, next year we may work at a different company but we’ll still be working. The stakes for us are high and real as it is about survival, feeding our families, educating our children. We do not overidentify with our jobs. We may take pride in our work, stay late, come in on weekends, but we recognise we are not our job descriptions. We master the technique of our jobs, have a sense of humour about it, and we receive praise or blame in the real world.<br>
          The amateur on the other hand overidentifies with his avocation, his/her artistic aspiration. They define themselves by it. He is a musician, a painter, a playwright. Pressfield argues Resistance loves this, because Resistance knows that the amateur composer will never write his symphony because he is overly invested in its success and terrified of its failure.<br>
          The amateur doesn’t show up everyday, they don’t show up no matter what. They don’t stay on the job all day, and quit when they’re bored, he/she is not committed over the long haul.<br><br>
          <em>&quot;He does not have a sense of humour about failure. You don’t hear him bitching “This fucking trilogy is killing me!” Instead, he doesn’t write his trilogy at all.&quot;</em><br><br>
          The amateur sits around waiting for motivation or inspiration to strike, while the professional just gets up and gets to work.<br><br>
          <em>&quot;Someone once asked Somerset Maugham if he wrote on a schedule or only when struck by inspiration. “I write only when inspiration strikes,” he replied. “Fortunately it strikes every morning at nine o’clock sharp.&quot;</em><br><br>
          Pressfield believes the pro should view their work as craft, not art. Not because art/business/creativity is devoid of a mystical dimension. On the contrary, the professional understands that all creative endeavour is holy, but doesn’t dwell on it. They know if they think about that too much, it will paralyse them.<br><br>
          <em>&quot;So she concentrates on technique. The professional masters how, and leaves what and why to the gods. Like Somerset Maugham she doesn’t wait for inspiration, she acts in the anticipation of its apparition. The professional is acutely aware of the intangibles that go into inspiration. Out of respect for them, she lets them work. She grants them their sphere while she concentrates on hers. The sign of the amateur is over glorification of and preoccupation with the mystery.&quot;</em><br><br>
          One of the overarching themes throughout the book, and perhaps the cornerstone of ‘turning pro’, is how one handles and deals with fear. Looking to the many artists and achievers throughout history provides us with a counterintuitive truth; one can never truly overcome fear, and the goal should not be to overcome it, but rather to act in spite of it, nay, because of it.<br><br>
          <em>​​&quot;The amateur believes he must first overcome his fear; then he can do his work. The professional knows that fear can never be overcome. He knows there is no such thing as a fearless warrior or a dread-free artist. What Henry Fonda does, after puking into the toilet in his dressing room, is to clean up and march out onstage. He is still terrified, but he forces himself forward in spite of his terror. He knows that once he gets out into the action, his fear will recede, and he’ll be okay.&quot;</em><br><br>
          The fear of failure, or the fear of rejection to our work, can be one of the most powerful reasons to never begin. Pressfield is not the first to harp on about this, and like many before him, he recognises that this fear is rooted in our ego.
          The fear of failure, whether regarding an enterprise, art, or journey of any sort, is more often the fear of being seen to have failed, or being deemed a failure. The reality is that failure represents an enormous potential threat to our egos, and so our ego comes to fear it. It should then come as no surprise that what the ego fears, we fear.<br><br>
          The solution is to have a “thick skin” Pressfield says, also what David Goggins would call a “callused mind” in his best-seller Can’t Hurt Me. When we seat our professional consciousness in a place other than our personal ego, we stand detached from criticism, setbacks, and failures. We will not see these criticisms as criticisms of the self, or such failures as failures of our character, but simply setbacks to be overcome.<br><br>
          Resistance feeds on fear, particularly the fear of failure. However, that is not the master fear. The master fear according to Pressfield is the fear that we will succeed. This is a terrifying prospect to face, because if true, then we become estranged from all we know. We know that if we embrace our ideals, we must prove worthy of them, and that scares the hell out of us.<br><br>
          The amateurs journey to becoming a professional, and the professionals journey towards self-actualisation is beset on all sides by Resistance.<br><br>
          <em>&quot;What I call Professionalism someone else might call the Artist’s Code or the Warrior’s Way. It is an attitude of egolessness and service. The Knights of the Round Table were chaste and self-effacing. Yet they duelled dragons. We are facing dragons too. Fire-breathing griffins of the soul, whom we must outfight and outwit to reach the treasure of our self-in-potential and to release the maiden who is God’s plan and destiny for ourselves and the answer to why we were put on this planet&quot;</em><br><br>
          Book Three: Beyond Resistance — Higher Realm<br><br>
          In Book One Pressfield lays down his thesis about resistance, and in Book Two, he teaches us about the ideals one must strive towards to overcome resistance, namely by turning pro. Book Three deals with the mystical, with Pressfield using powerful allegory to explain that there are divine forces that come to aid the professional along their journey, and he introduces the concept of “territory vs hierarchy’, which for me was one of the most powerful takeaways from a book already packed with gems.<br><br>
          Just as Resistance can be thought of as personal (terms like Resistance “loves” such and such or “hates” such and such), the call to growth can also be conceptualised as personal, with Pressfield referencing angels, muses, and the daimons of Greek mythology. Where Resistance has its seat in hell, creation has its home in heaven, and it’s not just a witness, but an eager an active ally.<br><br>
          I must admit I was not the biggest fan of Book Three on my first read through but have since come to value it just as much as the former chapters.<br><br>
          Concerning the unforeseen forces that aid one in the art of creation, this portion of Book Three can be summed up by the following passage from W.H. Murray from The Scottish Himalayan Expedition;<br><br>
          <em>&quot;Concerning all acts of initiative (and creation), there is one elementary truth, the ignorance of which kills countless ideas and splendid plans: that the moment one definitely commits oneself, then Providence moves too. All sorts of things occur to help one that would never otherwise have occurred. A whole stream of events issues from the decision, raising in one’s favour all manner of unforeseen incidents and meetings and material assistance, which no man could have dreamt would have come his way. I learned a deep respect for one of Goethe’s couplets: Whatever you can do or dream you can, begin it. Boldness has genius, power and magic in it!&quot;</em><br><br>
          Territory vs hierarchy<br>
          In the animal kingdom , individuals define themselves in one of two ways, by their rank within a hierarchy (pecking order), or by their connection to a territory (home base, hunting ground). This applies to humans also, and of the two orientations, the hierarchical seems to be the default setting.<br><br>
          For the artist to define themselves hierarchically is fatal Pressfield says. To examine why, we need to take a close look at the individual who defines themselves by their place in a pecking order. They will:
          <ol>
          <li>Compete against all others in the order, seeking to elevate his/her station by advancing against those above him, while defending his place against those beneath.</li>
          <li>Evaluate his/her happiness/success/achievement by their rank within the hierarchy, feeling most satisfied when they are high and most miserable when he’s low.</li>
          <li>Act toward others based upon their rank in the hierarchy, to the exclusion of all other factors.</li>
          <li>Evaluate his/her every move solely by the effect it produces on others.</li>
          </ol><br>
          They will act for others, dress for others, speak for others, think for others. But the artist cannot look to others to validate their efforts or calling.<br>
          <em>&quot;If you don’t believe me, ask Van Gogh, who produced masterpiece after masterpiece and never found a buyer in his whole life. The artist must operate territorially. He must do his work for its own sake. To labor in the arts for any reason other than love is prostitution.&quot;</em><br><br>
          The way forward for anyone in the pursuit of some higher goal is take on the territorial orientation.<br>
          <em>&quot;There’s a three-legged coyote who lives up the hill from me. All the garbage cans in the neighbourhood belong to him. It’s his territory. Every now and then some four-legged intruder tries to take over. They can’t do it. On his home turf, even a peg-leg critter is invincible. We humans have territories too. Ours are psychological. Stevie Wonder’s territory is the piano. Arnold Schwarzenegger’s is the gym. When Bill Gates pulls into the parking lot at Microsoft, he’s on his territory. When I sit down to write, I’m on mine.&quot;</em><br>
          A territory provides sustenance. Runners know what a territory is. So do rock climbers and kayakers and yogis. Artists and entrepreneurs know what a territory is too. The swimmer who towels off after finishing his lap feels a hell of a lot better than the tired, cranky person who dove into the pool thirty minutes earlier.<br><br>
          An easy way to tell if our orientation is territorial or hierarchical is to ask ourselves if no one in the world could see the results of our work, would we still do it? Pressfield argues that when you remove the possibility of recognition a hierarchical orientation makes no sense, so if you would still pursue that activity, congratulations, you’re doing it territorially.<br><br>
          <em>&quot;If Arnold Schwarzenegger were the last man on earth, he would still go the gym. Stevie Wonder would still pound the piano. The sustenance they get comes from the act itself, not from the impression it makes on others.&quot;</em><br><br>
          The concept of the territorial orientation can be summarised in this pithy phrase: outcome independence. To do our work for its own sake, not for fortune, attention, or applause. To love the process, the journey, including all the setbacks that come with it. To move forward in spite of setbacks or undesirable outcomes, because growth and forward movement is the goal.<br><br>
          In the Bhagavad Gita when Krishna instructed Arjuna that we have a right to our labour but not the fruits of our labour, he was counselling the warrior to act territorially. All the warrior can give is his life, all the athlete can do is leave everything on the field.<br><br>
          I finish my summary with the following passage from the conclusion of Book One, which I think captures the essence of the book;<br><br>
          <em>&quot;The sun isn’t up yet; it’s cold; the fields are sopping. Brambles scratch my ankles, branches snap back in my face. The hill is a sonofabitch but what can you do? Set one foot in front of another and keep climbing. An hour passes. I’m warmer now, the pace has got my blood going. The years have taught me one skill: how to be miserable. I know how to shut up and keep humping. This is a great asset because it’s human, the proper role for a mortal.<br><br> It does not offend the gods, but elicits their intercession. My bitching self is receding now. The instincts are taking over. Another hour passes. I turn the corner of a thicket and there he is: the nice fat hare I knew would show up if I just kept plugging. Home from the hill, I thank the immortals and offer up their portion of the kill. They brought it to me; they deserve their share. I am grateful. I joke with my kids beside the fire. They’re happy; the old man has brought home the bacon. The old lady’s happy; she’s cooking it up. I’m happy; I’ve earned my keep on the planet, at least for this day. Resistance is not a factor now. I don’t think of the hunt and I don’t think of the office. The tension drains from my neck and back. What I feel and say and do this night will not be coming from any disowned or unresolved part of me, any part corrupted by Resistance. I go to sleep content, but my final thought is of Resistance. I will wake up with it tomorrow. Already I am steeling myself.&quot;</em><br>
          The War of Art is a quick read, 3 hours cover to cover. Yet I doubt I really have any three hour periods in my life as impactful as when I read this classic. I still remember the feelings of both excitement and dread upon putting this book down, understanding that what I have been struggling with in my pursuits I will continue to struggle with for the rest of time.<br><br>
          I think the thing that makes the war of art so powerful for me is that it kind of taught me that anything worthwhile will be hard, and I will always struggle in the pursuit of any higher calling. The profound realisation for me was that this is just part and parcel of the game, of life. Understanding resistance was ground-breaking because once I realised it was part and parcel of the game, resistance’s manifestations were no longer good enough reasons to not do something, to not strive, to not go after things that I want to accomplish.<br>
          Basically, any reason I could possibly have for procrastinating/not attempting the things that hold value for me was nullified. Too tired to go to the gym today? Resistance. Too tired to go to the gym today and I have a bunch of errands to do and also I need to get up for work early tomorrow morning, so it’s probably best to either train tomorrow morning or after work? Resistance. I really want to take this class but I’m afraid I’ll struggle at it? Resistance. I really want to start on that dream business I’ve been planning but I don’t think I yet have the know-how to make a start? Resistance.<br>
          What would in the past appear to be sound rationalisations are now seen for what they are; resistance, and because resistance isn’t this thing that comes and goes, but is actually woven into the fabric of anything which requires effort and dedication, it no longer makes sense to yield to it.<br><br>
          <em>&quot;It may be that the human race is not ready for freedom. The air of liberty may be too rarefied for us to breathe. Certainly I wouldn’t be writing this book, on this subject, if living with freedom were easy. The paradox seems to be, as Socrates demonstrated long ago, that the truly free individual is free only to the extent of her own self-mastery. While those who will not govern themselves are condemned to find masters to govern over them.&quot;</em>
