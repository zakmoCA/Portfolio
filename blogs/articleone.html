        <h1>Four Thousand Weeks</h1>
        <p>
          Assuming you live to 80, you&rsquo;ll have lived about four thousand weeks. If you&rsquo;re anything like me and want to make the most of those four thousand or however many thousand weeks we actually get, then look no further than Oliver Burkeman&rsquo;s instant classic here.<br>
          <br>
          I must say, this is a different kind of &lsquo;productivity&rsquo; book if you&rsquo;re into that kind of thing, and it really flips the conventional productivity tips and tricks on their head, the author describing himself as a recovering productivity addict and wants us to think about time management through the lens if our imminent mortality.<br>
          <br>
          I came across this on Ali Abdaal&rsquo;s channel last year and have just finished rereading it for the third time. Now I have three key takeaways from this book;<br>
          <br>
          Embracing finitude as the solution to what Burkeman calls existential overwhelm and the efficiency trap.<br><br>
          Becoming a better procrastinator, as Burkeman states that the real measure of any time management technique is whether or not it helps you neglect the right things.<br><br>
          Acknowledging the inevitability of discomfort<br><br>
          Considering how little time we have on this earth, you would think time management would be everyone&rsquo;s concern. Arguably, time management is all life is. Although time management is really important, the way we generally think of it in society, which might have something to do with all that&rsquo;s been written on the subject, is about getting as much done as we humanly can. It&rsquo;s about streamlining and making efficient even the most mundane of tasks, like email, but little thought is ever given to whether or not we should be trying to squeeze as much as possible from our day.<br>
          <br>
          This was immediately interesting to me, I have been introduced to this idea that less is more by Greg McKeown in Essentialism, and somewhat tangentially by Cal Newport in Deep Work.<br>
          <br>
          Burkeman says that &ldquo;the real problem isn&rsquo;t our limited time. The real problem is that we&rsquo;ve unwittingly inherited, and feel pressured to live by, a troublesome set of ideas about how to use our limited time, all of which are pretty much guaranteed to make things worse.&rdquo;<br>
          <br>
          When you are faced with too many demands on your time, it is easy to think the only answer is to make better use of your time, instead of asking whether the demands themselves are reasonable. Time then becomes a thing you feel the need to dominate and control, if you are to avoid feeling guilty, panicked, or overwhelmed. The solution to this according to Burkeman, which brings me to my first key takeaway is embracing finitude.<br>
          <br>
          You&rsquo;ll never be able to master your time, and the more work we do, the more there is to do.<br>
          <br>
          Oliver Burkeman was a productivity nut, who spent years trying to optimise his time management skills, when one day he had an epiphany; his efforts to optimise his time were futile.<br>
          <br>
          Sure he could get to inbox zero, but getting really good at responding to emails only led to more emails, while the things he actually valued like researching for articles he had planned to write, were left undone.<br>
          <br>
          Burkeman had fallen into what he calls the efficiency trap. Rendering yourself more efficient will generally not result in you having more time because all else being equal, your demands will increase to offset the benefits. &ldquo;Even the winners find their reward is to continue working with crushing intensity&rdquo;.<br>
          <br>
          This can lead to a feeling of existential overwhelm, where we feel like there&rsquo;s an inexhaustible supply of things that seem worth doing, and we can&rsquo;t possibly get around to doing them all. So what&rsquo;s the solution?<br>
          <br>
          Choose. Choose what is important, what deserves your time. &ldquo;Once you no longer need to convince yourself that you&rsquo;ll do everything that needs doing, you&rsquo;re free to focus on doing a few things that count.&rdquo; Trying to &lsquo;get everything done&rsquo; is another way of trying to avoid the question of what to truly do with your finite time.<br>
          <br>
          One reason I think this is one of the best productivity books I&rsquo;ve read, is that Burkeman delves to the core of the human condition, and comes at time management from a philosophical angle.<br>
          <br>
          Fretting to and fro, taking on inconceivable numbers of projects, it&rsquo;s almost as if we are staunchly denying our impending mortality. Truly recognising the shortness of life, and the massive limits that places on what you can reasonably get done in a lifetime, would force you to give up on almost all your pursuits, all but the most important ones.<br>
          <br>
          This loss of optionality is scary for some, it definitely was for me. The decision to do any given thing will automatically mean sacrificing an infinite number of potential alternative paths.<br>
          <br>
          So how can we overcome this? By becoming better procrastinators.<br>
          <br>
          &ldquo;The real measure of any time management technique is whether or not it helps you neglect the right things.&rdquo;<br>
          <br>
          Burkeman provides three principles to do this; paying yourself first, limiting your &lsquo;work in progress&rsquo;, and &lsquo;resisting the allure of middling priorities.<br>
          <br>
          Principle 1 &mdash; Pay Yourself First<br>
          <br>
          This comes from the personal finance principle of paying yourself first whenever you receive your paycheque.<br>
          <br>
          The idea is that you take a specified amount, let&rsquo;s say 20% of your pay, and put it straight into a savings account or investment portfolio, the reasoning being that by paying yourself first, you are ensuring you are continuously working towards your financial goals, and not simply just saving money whenever you happen to have money left in the bank at the end of your pay cycle. By doing it first, you ensure it happens, every pay-cycle.<br>
          <br>
          We can pay ourselves first with regards to our time by carving out time to tackle the things most important to us each day, preferably in the morning.<br>
          <br>
          This way we make sure those things don&rsquo;t simply remain an afterthought, but that they get done each day.<br>
          <br>
          If a certain activity really matters to you, a creative project for example, carve out an hour each morning before you start getting ready for work to get it done.<br>
          <br>
          Principle 2 &mdash; Limit Your Work in Progress<br>
          <br>
          Having a lot of &lsquo;started but not finished&rsquo; projects does not make you productive, it just makes you distracted.<br>
          <br>
          I am guilty of this one big time, and feel like the subconscious reason I do this is because it allows me to feel like I&rsquo;m &lsquo;doing something&rsquo; as I have plenty of irons in the fire, and think I am making progress on all fronts.<br>
          <br>
          In reality, I am making progress on no fronts, because each time one of these side projects gets difficult or boring or frightening, I can bounce off to something else instead. This lets us preserve our sense of &lsquo;being in control of things&rsquo; but at the cost of never finishing anything important.<br>
          <br>
          This can be avoided by fixing a hard upper limit on what you are allowed to work on at any given time, and the author gives us the concept of the open and closed list, which is just brilliant.<br>
          <br>
          Your open list has everything you&rsquo;d like to get done with no regard for time, but the closed list has only 3 slots. You don&rsquo;t get to move something from the open list to the closed until you&rsquo;ve made space for it, so until you&rsquo;ve crossed off 1 of the 3 items in your closed list. Focusing on the closed list allows you to do what matters and prevents half finished projects.<br>
          <br>
          This ties well into principle 3, which is to resist the allure of middling priorities.<br>
          <br>
          Principle 3 &mdash; Resist The Allure of Middling Priorities<br>
          <br>
          Warren Buffet has a principle, its come to be known as the 5/25 rule; it goes like this.<br>
          <br>
          List your top 25 professional goals, this can also include personal goals as well, from most important to least important. Now cross out goals 6 to 25, and disregard them entirely. This is because the remaining 20 goals are insufficiently important enough to form the core of your life, but they&rsquo;re the ones that are seductive enough to distract you from what really matters.<br>
          <br>
          Learning to say no isn&rsquo;t just about saying no to the things you don&rsquo;t want to do, it also applies to the things you do want to do, but that are not priorities for your fulfilment and happiness.<br>
          <br>
          Now this brings us to our third and final key takeaway, which I think is the most important because it ties everything in together, and that is acknowledging the inevitability of discomfort.<br>
          <br>
          This discomfort Burkeman is talking about, this existential overwhelm, of dread, of the fear of missing out, is why we fall into things like the efficiency trap, and take on more than we can handle, with our real priorities sometimes being casualties in the process.<br>
          <br>
          The solution, says Burkeman, is to accept that this unpleasantness, is what it feels like for finite humans to commit ourselves to the kinds of demanding and valuable tasks that force us to confront our limited control on how our lives unfold.<br>
          <br>
          Steven Pressfield calls this &lsquo;unpleasantness&rsquo; the &lsquo;Resistance&rsquo; in his book The War of Art, which I definitely recommend. We often face resistance which you can think of as the thing that stops you or makes it difficult to the things you need to do, and the more important and/or challenging a task is, the more resistance we will face.<br>
          <br>
          This resistance is why it is easy to get distracted, and to distract ourselves with less important tasks whenever we feel uncomfortable by the challenge of the task in front of us.<br>
          <br>
          Burkeman says that what we think of as distractions, aren&rsquo;t the ultimate cause of our being distracted, but that they are just the places we go to seek relief from this feeling of &lsquo;discomfort&rsquo;, this &lsquo;resistance&rsquo;, this discomfort of confronting our finitude, our limited time.<br>
          <br>
          &ldquo;Some Zen Buddhists hold that the entirety of human suffering can be boiled down to this effort to resist paying full attention to the way things are going, because we wish they were going differently (&lsquo;This shouldn&rsquo;t be happening!&rsquo;), or because we wish we felt more in control of the process. There is a very down-to-earth kind of liberation in grasping that there are certain truths about being a limited human from which you&rsquo;ll never be liberated. You don&rsquo;t get to dictate the course of events. And the paradoxical reward for accepting reality&rsquo;s constraints is that they no longer feel so constraining.&rdquo;<br>
          <br>
          There is no fancy way around it other than just acknowledging this discomfort, and acknowledging that this finitude is what it means to be human. And because we can&rsquo;t possibly do everything we would like to, it behooves us choose the few things that matter, sacrifice everything else, and deal with the inevitable sense of loss that results from time to time.
