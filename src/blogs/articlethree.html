        <h1>Congruence As A Life-Hack</h1>
        <p>
          &ldquo;Behavior that is incongruent with the self will not last&rdquo; says James Clear in his best-seller Atomic Habits.<br>
          <br>
          What James Clear is referring to here by &lsquo;congruence&rsquo; is an idea explored by American Psychologist Carl Rogers, building on the work of Abraham Maslow and Maslow&rsquo;s heirarchy. Rogers believed that for a person to achieve self-actualization, they must be in a state of congruence.<br>
          <br>
          When our ideal self, and our actual self are consistent or very similar, a state of congruence exists. Naturally, it is rare for one to achieve a state of total congruence.<br>
          <br>
          Rogers believed that we want to feel, experience, and behave in ways consistent with our self-image.<br>
          <br>
          This has profound implications for someone on the journey of self-development.<br>
          <br>
          If for example, we think of ourselves as &lsquo;not a runner&rsquo; then it is much easier to skip out on our run for the afternoon, as we are not technically acting inconsistently with our perceived identity.<br>
          <br>
          One of the key things James Clear harps on about in Atomic Habits is just how much &lsquo;identity change&rsquo; matters in establishing and maintaining habits.<br>
          <br>
          The thesis of the book is that instead of thinking &lsquo;I want to do x&rsquo; we need to instead think &lsquo;I want to be the kind of person that does x&rsquo; or &lsquo;I want to be an x person&rsquo;.<br>
          <br>
          So instead of &lsquo;I want to start running&rsquo;, think &lsquo;I want to be a runner&rsquo;. Once something is ingrained in our identity, performing the action is effortless, as we are just &lsquo;being ourselves&rsquo;.<br>
          <br>
          I like to use my own version of this, that I call the &lsquo;congruence hack&rsquo;.<br>
          <br>
          This is done by performing an action which in turn forces me to perform another action, just so as to stay consistent with the first action.<br>
          <br>
          Otherwise it will have been for nothing and pretty stupid to have done.<br>
          <br>
          I&rsquo;m not really a morning person, but I make it a habit to always wake up early and to get started on my days work around 5am.<br>
          <br>
          My reasoning is that if I wake up at 5am, get out of bed, shower, and pour myself a cup of tea, it would then be inconceivable to do anything else but attack the days work that is in front of me.<br>
          <br>
          Because why else would I have left the comfort of my bed a few hours before I needed to?
